# Old-IOD
Replaces new iod with old iod

## Installation
Make a folder (or use an existing one) called `_mods` in your `/TERA/Client/S1Client/CookedPC` and pop the file in there.

## Issues
While the terrain matches up 100% with current IOD, some props are missing and others may view you clipping through the ground.
